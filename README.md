To become a Member of [@morganey-lang] community one
should [make a community request][community-requests]. The
request will be handled by one of the Owners.

Member can leave the community at any time.

## Becoming a Project Leader ##

If anyone have an Open Source, Morganey-related project, they can join
the community as a Project Leader by transferring the ownership of
the project to [@morganey-lang].

It is required to
file [a community request][community-requests] before actually
transferring the repo to:

* let the community members know about upcoming new project, and
* have a place to ask Owners for help if any technical difficulties arise during
  the repo transfer.

PLs can transfer their repos back at any time. Before
performing the actual back transfer, PL should
submit [a community request][community-requests] to notify the
community members about project leaving the community. A brief
explanation of the reason for leaving the community is
appreciated but optional. Owners should help with any technical
difficulties that may arise during the back transfer.

If anyone wants to start an Open Source, Morganey-related project right
in the [@morganey-lang] community, they can
submit [a community request][community-requests] with brief
description of the project idea. If the idea is accepted by
community members a new repo should be created and the creator of
the community request becomes the Project Leader of the new project.

Back transfer also applies to the projects that initially started in
[@morganey-lang]. They can be transferred to the Project Leader.

The Project Leaders are responsible for organizing the development
process of the projects they lead.
