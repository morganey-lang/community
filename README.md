## Becoming a Project Leader ##

If anyone have an Open Source Morganey related project, they can join
the community as a Project Leader by transfering the ownership of
the project to [@morganey-lang].

It is required to
file [an community request][community-requests] before actually
transfering the repo to let the community members know about
upcoming new project and have a place to ask Owners for help if any
technical difficulties happen during the repo transfer.

PLs can transfer their repos back if at any time. To do that before
performing the actual back transfer PL have to
submit [an community request][community-requests] to notify the
community members about a project leaving the community. A brief
explanation about the reason of leaving the community is
appreciated but optional. Owners should help with any technical
difficulties that may happen during the back transfer.

submit [an community request][community-requests] with brief
description of the project idea. If the idea is accepted by
community members a new repo should be created and the reporter of
the community request becomes the Project Leader of a new project.

Back transfer also applies to the projects that initially started in
[@morganey-lang]. They can be transfered to the Project Leader.

The Project Leader is responsible for organizing the development
process of the projects they lead.
