## Becoming a Member ##

To become a Member of [@morganey-lang] organization one
should [make an organization request][organization-requests]. The

Member can leave the organization at any time.

## Becoming a Project Leader ##

If anyone have an Open Sourced Morganey related project, they can join
the organization as a Project Leader by transfering the ownership of
the project to [@morganey-lang].

## Draft of the Rules ##

- Anyone can join @morganey-lang organization as a Member

- If someone have an Open Sourced Morganey related project, they can join the organization as a Project Leader by transfering the ownership of the project to @morganey-lang. What that means:

    - The Project Leader preserves all of the legal rights on the transfered project. From the technical point of view I will make sure that after the transfering the ownership the Project Leader has enough control over their repo.

    - The Project Leader can transfer their project back. From the technical point of view I will help to do that.

    - The Project Leader continues to decide on how to organize the development process of the transfered repo.

    - The Project Leader can transfer the project to @morganey-lang completely which includes (but not limited to) transfering all of the legal rights on the project, ability to transfer the ownership of the project back, ability to organize the development process of the project. (This is required if the Project Leader cannot work on the project anymore and don't want the project to die. They simply donate the project to the organization).

    - Transfering the project gives

        - featuring the project on the morganey web-site (we probably gonna have one)
        - more contributors from the members and the neighbor projects
        - ???

## Creating a new repo ##

Creating a new repo in the organization is a serious decision and
should be properly discussed with organization Owners and
Members. Preferably via a request to the [organization] repo.
