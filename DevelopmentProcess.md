# Development Process Guidelines

These guidelines are indended to be used by [@morganey-lang] community
members while working on [@morganey-lang]'s projects.

They are completely optional, because [per rules](README.md#becoming-a-project-leader):

> The Project Leaders are responsible for organizing the development process of the projects they lead.

So, before contributing anything to any of the [@morganey-lang]'s projects, ask a corresponding Project Leader about development process details. See [Projects.md](Projects.md) for the full list of [@morganey-lang] projects and their corresponding Project Leaders.

If you're a Project Leader, consider following these practices.

## Release Process

- [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver] should be used for versioning project artifacts.
- Everything that goes into each individual release should be captured in the issue tracker.
- Each release should be planned a set of issues grouped into a milestone (See [GitHub Milestones][github-milestones] for more info)
- The release milestone should be named as a corresponding release version.
- Once all issues in the release milestone are closed the corresponding version of the project artifacts should be released (See [GitHub Releases][github-releases] for more info)
- The Project Leader should be responsible for creating and organizing release milestones and performing artifact releases via [GitHub Releases](github-releases) mechanism.
- The preferable way of letting the Project Leader know that a particular issue should be included in a particular release is to leave a comment in the corresponding issue.
